    <description>
      <p>The Hell Bots are a unique race of beings forged in the depths of the Nine Hells. Infused with infernal energy, they possess mechanical bodies and a burning will that sets them apart from other races.</p>
      <h4>HELLISH RESILIENCE</h4>
      <p>Thanks to their infernal origins, Hell Bots have resistance to fire damage, and they are immune to being poisoned.</p>
